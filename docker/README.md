Docker image for this repository
================================================================================

You don't need to build a Docker image by yourself because the docker image is
already available from the Dockerhub. You can download the image and launch
new container just by running `docker_run.sh` in your terminal.

If you want to update the Docker image, you can build it again by the following
command:

```console
sh build.sh
```
